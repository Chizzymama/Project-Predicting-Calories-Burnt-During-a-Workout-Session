## Predicting Calories Burnt During a Workout Session 🔥
This project explores how machine learning can be used to predict the number of calories burnt during a workout session based on various physiological and activity-related metrics. With fitness tracking and health monitoring becoming increasingly data-driven, the ability to predict calorie expenditure can offer valuable insights for individuals and fitness professionals alike.

## Project Objective 🎯
The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates calories burnt during a workout using features such as:

Age

Gender

Height & Weight

Duration of workout

Heart rate

Body temperature

The outcome is a regression model that can help users monitor their fitness goals and personalize their workout routines.

## Dataset Overview 📊
The dataset used contains various biometric and workout-related attributes. It includes:

Demographics (Age, Gender)

Physical measures (Height, Weight, Body Temperature)

Workout metrics (Duration, Heart Rate)

Target variable: Calories Burnt

## Tools & Technologies Used 🛠️
Python
Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation
Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
Scikit-learn for machine learning modeling (Linear Regression)

Google Colab for code execution and sharing

## Project Workflow 🚀 
Data Cleaning, Preprocessing & Feature Engineering
Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Uncovering patterns and correlations using visualizations.

Model Building
Training multiple regression models to predict calories burnt.

Model Evaluation
Using performance metrics like MAE, MSE, and R² to evaluate model effectiveness.

Final Predictions & Insights
Interpreting model results and potential use cases.

Built a reliable model to predict calories burnt from biometric and workout metrics.

Gained insights into which factors (Age_Group, heart rate, duration) most strongly influence calorie burn.

Demonstrated how data science can be applied in the health and fitness domain.
